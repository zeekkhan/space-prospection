        <h2>Delivery Information</h2>
        <p>Orders placed by 3 pm are posted on the same day.</p>
        <p>We use the Evri postal network via our partners at HubEurope. We offer 2 delivery options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Express, Next day, tracked (£8.99)</li>
            <li>Economy, 2-4 day, tracked (£6.99)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You will receive an email confirmation once you have placed your order, and a dispatch confirmation email upon the order being released for shipping. Evri will separately email you with a tracker and link to the latest updates/info.</p>
        <p>Please note that all the above information is based on estimates/expectations. Due to our offshore location, issues such as adverse weather conditions or differing bank holidays may extend delivery times due to the disruption of outgoing boats/planes from the island. The majority of our orders are delivered in advance of the expectation, but there are cases where delays occur that are out of our control.</p>
